                <em>❕ Click the table headers (Title, Artist, Genre, Rating) to sort.</em>
                <p>This app was built in React as an excerise using state and input elements.
                    I have used concepts I learned from Bob Ziroll's Scrimba course about React.</p>
                <p>While building this app I found out that with
                    <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare"
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer"
                    >
                        <code>localeCompare</code>
                    </a>
                    you can sort numerically and alphabetically,
                    but also based on the number of emoji's in a string
                    (like the stars I used in this app for the rating).
                </p>
                <p>Just for fun I added the option to search for the songs on YouTube. 😁 </p>
